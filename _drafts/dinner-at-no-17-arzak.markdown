PICTURE OF MENU COVER

Unassumingly located on a busy street in San Sebastian, we were greeted by a concierge on departure from our taxi.

Warmly welcomed in Spanish, we were shown to our table - in spite of being thirty minutes early. To start, a lightly refreshing house cocktail - whilst we waited for the head waiter.

On arrival, he spoke Spanish - thankfully we spoke enough to have a conversation, but opted for the menu to be explained in English. It was suggested that we chose the taster menu, in order to get a complete experience of the range offered.

Light, yet plentiful appetizers arrived shortly afterwards.

LIST

* Moringa and prawn gyoza
  - Freshly cooked 
* Banana and squid
  - Elaborately presented
* "Txistorra" with beer and mango
  - Yes, that is a crushed beer can
* Marinated white tuna and strawberry
  - No cheese for me, delicious none the less
* Strawberry bitter
  - Edible cork made of Mango and ham, drinkable fluid in the bottle

END LIST

Following these, and as we had finished the cocktails - we eyed up the wine list. At which point we were greeted with a knowledgeable (shit hot) sommelier who suggested a white known as Txomin Extaniz. After checking the smell of the cork, he poured one of the nicest wines I have ever tasted. 

What follows are our dishes, each tailored to our dietary requirements. For example, I can’t eat cheese - meaning my choices were more unique than others. It would be interesting to see how well they cater for pescetarians and such, it was mostly fish - so pretty well, I imagine.

DISHES, WITH PIC AND EXPL

* Beetroot blood apple
* Crab “rock”
  - Presented in a salt rock dish was crab over seaweed, with huitaloche
* Lobster with bees pollen
  - First a screen with an ocean scene appeared, followed by the dish
  - Not ruberry 
* Fish of the day with “patxaran” and purple corn
  - Melt in your mouth fish
* Red space egg
  - A red skin covering a beautifully poached egg
* White tuna’s tamale

* Monkfish with rhubarb

* Pigeon with guitar shavings
   - Cooked medium as requested
* Beef with green tea
   - Pink as asked
* Slightly spiced beef, toasted leeks sponge cake, hop sauce and “green tea smoke” - when poured, the dish was infused

_Desserts_

* The big truffle
  - Fell apart inside out as the sauce was poured over it
* Square moon
  - Honeycomb ice cream
* Black lemon
  - I’m not the biggest fan of lemon, but the sweet citrus cream interior made it enjoyable
* Spherical melon and jujube
  - Exploded in mouth
  - Basil ice cream

END DISHES, WITH PIC AND EXPL

Mid we through the meal, I spotted our sommelier carrying nine wine glasses in one and - and three bottles in the other, as if it were a natural occurrence. 

To finish, we were presented with some specialised sweets and opted for a post dinner G&T - the gin (again, recommended - and the bottle shown to us) was Bahia. 

PICS OF SWEETS AND G & T

After settling our bill, a taxi was called for us and we were made welcome whilst we waited for it to arrive.

Overall, the decor was simple yet effective. The staff were very friendly and attentive, but not at all in your face or pushy. Juan Mari Arzak himself made an appearance, and spoke Spanish with us. 

We were in the restaurant for four or five hours, but didn’t notice the time pass. It was one of the best meal experiences I have experienced, and certainly the best restaurant I’ve been to.
